# Checklists catalog

A web interface for working with open-checklists.

## Running locally

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`

## How it works

Checklists catalog uses [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/) for 
working with checklists.

Just create a `.json` file in the `content` directory.

To create an open-checklists json file you can use [the constructor](https://github.com/cyevgeniy/open-checklist-constructor).
